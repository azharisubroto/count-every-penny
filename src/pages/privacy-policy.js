                    AI is required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and is bound by the Australian Privacy
                    Principles (<strong>APPs</strong>) set out in that Act. The APPs establish minimum standards for the
                    collection, use, disclosure and handling of personal information. They apply to personal information
                    in any form, including electronic and digital form. The APPs can be accessed at the website of the

                    AI needs to be able to collect personal information for most of its business activities, although
                    the information we require depends on the particular circumstances. If we are unable to collect the
                    personal information we need, we may be unable to meet the expectations of our customers or provide
                    the products and services they wish to receive.
